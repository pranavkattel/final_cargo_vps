## 🚨 CRITICAL: Why You're Still Not Showing

Even with perfect SEO, you won't rank because:

### 1. **NOT INDEXED BY GOOGLE** ❌
Test: Search `site:cargocapital.com` on Google
- If NO RESULTS = Google hasn't found your site yet
- **This is the #1 reason you don't show up**

### 2. **NO BACKLINKS** ❌
Google won't rank sites with 0 backlinks
- Need minimum 10-15 quality backlinks
- Even with perfect on-page SEO

### 3. **NO GOOGLE MY BUSINESS** ❌
Local searches heavily rely on GMB
- "cargo company in nepal" = local intent
- Without GMB, you lose 40% of visibility
