   - [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (Frontend hosting)
   - [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas) (Database)

2. **Deploy Backend to Railway:**

   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login and deploy
   railway login
   railway create cargo-backend
   railway up
   ```

3. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm install -g vercel
   
   # Deploy frontend
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Setup Database:**
   - Create MongoDB Atlas cluster (free tier)
   - Add connection string to Railway environment variables
   - Run database seeding script

### Option 2: All-in-One with Netlify
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
# Drag 'dist' folder to netlify.com/drop
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Optional but Recommended)

### Quick MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. **Create Account:** [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
2. **Create Cluster:** Choose free tier (M0)
3. **Get Connection String:** 
   - Click "Connect" → "Connect Application"
   - Copy the connection string
4. **Update Environment:**
   ```env
   # In backend/.env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/cargo-capital
   ```
5. **Seed Database:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node scripts/seedData.js
   ```

**Note:** The app works perfectly without a database using built-in demo data!
